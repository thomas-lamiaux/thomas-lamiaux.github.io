Our paper [Computing Cohomology Rings in Cubical Agda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04182)
with Axel Ljungström and [Anders Mörtberg](https://staff.math.su.se/anders.mortberg/),
was accepted at [CPP 2023](https://popl23.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2023#) and awarded
Distinguished Paper.
In the paper, we explain how to formalize Cohomology Rings in synthetic mathematics.
With a special focus on data structures and how they influence formalization,
most noticeably the direct sum and (multivariate) polynomials.
