short-description:
  I will give at talk at the workshop [DuctCat](https://dutchcats.github.io/)
  about entitled "Introduction and comparison of different approaches to
  Initial Semantics", in which we will discuss the different approaches and
  how they relate.

Initial Semantics is a categorical framework enabling to abstractly
represent and manipulate syntax with binder e.g. lambda calculus, with an
appropriate notion of substitution and recursion. This is of important as
substitution is famously hard to account properly in a formal setting.

In this talk, we will first consider different approaches that exist in the
literature, namely before giving some elements on how the different
approaches relates and can be seen as instances of a unified framework.
