I am a 4th year student at [Ens Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en)
in theoretical computer science.
I am currently working with [Benedikt Ahrens](https://benediktahrens.gitlab.io/)
on a unified framework for initial semantics, and with
[Ambroise Lafont](https://amblafont.github.io/) on leveraging the parametricity
of such frameworks in the input category.

My main interests are :
- Type Theory
- Proof Assistants
- Functional Programming Languages
- Categorical Semantics
