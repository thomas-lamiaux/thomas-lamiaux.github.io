I am a 1st year phd student in the [Gallinette team](https://gallinette.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/)
at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) & [Nantes University](https://english.univ-nantes.fr/),
under the direction of [Nicolas Tabareau](https://tabareau.fr/), [Yannick Forster](https://yforster.de/),
and [Matthieu Sozeau](https://sozeau.gitlabpages.inria.fr/www/). <br>
I am working on Proof Assistants, most particularly on generating recursors for
inductive types using MetaCoq, and towards formalising Coq's guard condition.

On the side of my phd, I am pushing forward the project
[Coq Platform Docs](https://github.com/coq/platform-docs)
aiming at documenting Coq and its Platform.

I am also working on some other projects linked to initial semantics  :
- Leveraging the parametricity of initial semantics framework in the input
  monoidal category with [Ambroise Lafont](https://amblafont.github.io/)
- Reformulating and extending some notions of initial semantics to polymorphic
  languages with [Benedikt Ahrens](https://benediktahrens.gitlab.io/) and
  [Ambroise Lafont](https://amblafont.github.io/)
