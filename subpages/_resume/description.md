I am a 4th year student at [Ens Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en)
in theoretical computer science.
I am mostly interested in proof assistants, type theory, and other related notions.

I am currently working on :
- Generating recursors for inductive types for Coq using MetaCoq, and on
  verifying Coq's guard condition with [Nicolas Tabareau](https://tabareau.fr/)
- Leveraging the parametricity of initial semantics framework in the input
  monoidal category with [Ambroise Lafont](https://amblafont.github.io/)
- Reformulating and extending some notions of initial semantics to polymorphic
  languages with [Benedikt Ahrens](https://benediktahrens.gitlab.io/) and
  [Ambroise Lafont](https://amblafont.github.io/)

in theoretical computer science.
I am currently working with [Benedikt Ahrens](https://benediktahrens.gitlab.io/)
on a unified framework for initial semantics, and with
[Ambroise Lafont](https://amblafont.github.io/) on leveraging the parametricity
of such frameworks in the input category.

My main interests are :
- Type Theory
- Proof Assistants
- Functional Programming Languages
- Categorical Semantics -->
