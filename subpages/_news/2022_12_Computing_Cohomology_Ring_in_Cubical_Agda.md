Our paper [Computing Cohomology Rings in Cubical
Agda](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3573105.3575677) with Axel
[Ljungström](https://aljungstrom.github.io/) and [Anders
Mörtberg](https://staff.math.su.se/anders.mortberg/), was accepted at [CPP
2023](https://popl23.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2023#) and awarded **Distinguished
Paper**.

In the paper, we explain how to formalize Cohomology Rings in synthetic
mathematics. With a special focus on data structures and how they influence
formalization, most noticeably the direct sum and (multivariate)
polynomials.
